# Excel-Creating-a-3D-map
Create a 3D Map.
Select the Map Data worksheet.
This worksheet contains information about sales made in various states and regions of the U.S. The total sales amount for each transaction is noted, along with the state, region, and date when the transaction occurred.
Verify that a cell in the table is selected.
Select Insert→3D Map.
You may see the following prompt if the Data Analysis add-ins aren't enabled on your computer.
If you are prompted to enable the Data Analysis add-ins, select Enable.
Note: It may take a few moments for 3D Maps to activate.
If the Field List pane is showing, close it.
Confirm that state data will be used as the basis for the visualization.
In the Layer Pane, in the Location section, verify that State has been identified as shown here.
Based on the data in your source worksheet, the 3D Maps feature has detected the state field in your source worksheet and is using it as the location data that will be plotted in the visualization. You can change which field is used as the source for 3D mapping, but in this case, mapping one data point for each state was a good guess, and is exactly what your current needs call for.
Select the type of visualization and center the view as necessary.
In the Layer Pane, below the Data section header, select the Bubble visualization.
The markers change from small squares to small circles.
Select the Zoom in or Zoom out buttons and drag the map as needed to size and position the map so that North America is fully visible and centered.
Scale the data points based on total sales in each state.
Observe the map.
Each state is represented by a dot, but there is not yet any representation of the different sales amounts for each state.
In the Size section, select Add Field.
Select Total Sales.
The size of the data points now corresponds to the total sales for each state. Larger dots represent states with higher sales amounts. However, the dots may be too large, overlapping so much they are hard to compare in some areas, such as the eastern part of the country.
Adjust the scaling of dots.
Select the arrow next to Layer Options to expand that section.
Drag the Size slider to the right or left until you are pleased with the size of the dots.
The dots should be large enough so you can see the difference in sales volume for each state without being so large that you can't see the states they're associated with.
Use color coding to show region divisions.
In the Category section, select Add Field.
Select Region.
Color coding is now used to group the states into the various regions identified in the Map Data worksheet.
Select Home→Map Labels.
You may observe that it is hard to see the data on the East Coast where the states are so close together. Some state labels may not be shown, depending on the zoom level of the map.
Select Home→Map Labels to turn labels off again.
Format the legend and adjust the map layout as needed.
In the Layer Pane, in the Layer 1 heading, select the Rename this layer button.
Select Layer 1, type Develetech Sales and press Enter.
Reduce the size of the legend by dragging the bottom-right size handle up to remove extra white space.
Use the zoom buttons and drag the map as needed so you can see most or all of the data points in the United States.
Create a second scene that zooms in on the Northeast region.
Select Home, select the New Scene drop-down arrow, then select Copy Scene 1.
In the left pane, make sure Scene 2 is selected.
Select Home→Flat Map.
Use the zoom buttons and drag the map as needed so that Scene 2 focuses on the data points in the Northeast region as shown.
Apply a theme to Scene 2.
Select Home→Themes.
Select the Aerial Color theme.
Note: When this course was written, the Aerial Color theme was the second theme in the first row. Unfortunately, the themes aren't labeled by name. But when you position your mouse pointer over a theme, its name will be shown after a moment.
Adjust the map and play Scene 2.
In the Layer Pane, in the Develetech Sales heading, select the Rename this layer button.
Select Develetech Sales, type Northeast Region and press Enter.
Resize the legend to fit the new title, if necessary.
Play the tour with both scenes.
Select Home→Play Tour.
Each scene has 10 seconds as the default display time. The first scene shows a wide view. After 10 seconds, the view changes to the Northeast region.
Select the Go back to Edit view arrow in the lower-left corner.
Close the files.
In the 3D Maps window, select File→Close.
Save and close the My Develetech Sales.xlsx workbook.
